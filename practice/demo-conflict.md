## What Makes Git Awesome?

Git is an essential tool for modern development because it enables collaboration, version control, and seamless teamwork.

## Why This Demo Matters

Conflicts are a normal part of team development. When two people edit the same line of code, Git needs human help to decide which version to keep. 

**What you'll see:**
- Two instructors editing the same line at the same time
- How Git detects the conflict
- What conflict markers look like
- How to resolve it collaboratively
- How the resolved code gets merged back

**Remember:** Conflicts aren't errorsâ€”they're Git asking for your input!

**Pro tip:** If you're ever unsure which version to keep during a conflict, talk to the person you conflicted with. Two brains are better than one! ðŸ§ ðŸ§
