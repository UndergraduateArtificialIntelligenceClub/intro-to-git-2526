# 🚀 Git Happens: Learn Git by Breaking Things (and Fixing Them)

**UAIS Hands-On Git Workshop — Fall 2025-2026**

Welcome! This isn't your typical "watch me code" workshop. You're going to get your hands dirty, make mistakes, break things, and learn how to fix them. Because that's how real development works.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
- **Actually understand** what Git is doing (not just copy-paste commands)
- Clone repos, create branches, and make commits like a pro
- Push and pull changes without breaking everything
- Handle merge conflicts without panicking
- Use Git in real team projects
- Recover from mistakes (because we all make them)

---

## 🛠️ Before We Start

### You'll Need:
- ✅ **Git** installed
- ✅ **VS Code** or any code editor ([get VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- ✅ **GitHub account** ([sign up free](https://github.com/))
- ✅ **Terminal/Command Prompt** open and ready

**Don't have Git yet?** No worries! We'll walk through installation and setup together in [Task 1: Setup & Configuration](tasks/01-setup.md).

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Type every command yourself.** Don't copy-paste. Muscle memory matters.
- **Make mistakes on purpose.** Seriously. Break stuff and fix it.
- **Use `git status` constantly.** It's your best friend.
- **Read the error messages.** Git actually tells you what to do.
- **Ask questions.** There are no dumb questions in learning.

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Permission denied" when pushing?
You probably need to set up SSH keys or use a personal access token. Check [GitHub's auth guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication).

### Stuck in Vim?
Type `:q` and hit Enter. Next time, set VS Code as your editor (we did this in setup).
