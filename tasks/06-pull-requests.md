# Task 6: Pull Requests & Code Review

**Goal:** Learn how teams review and merge code using Pull Requests.

---

## üîç What's a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge your branch into main. It's where:
- Teammates review your code
- You discuss changes
- Code gets approved before merging

**Think of it as:** "Hey team, can you check this out before we add it to main?"

---

## üé® The PR Workflow

```
1. Write code on your branch
2. Push to GitHub
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Team reviews and comments
5. You address feedback
6. PR gets approved
7. Merge into main
8. Delete the branch
```

## üìù Instructions
